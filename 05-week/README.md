Simulations for a GPD distribution under the Mmax and mean reparameterisation.
This reparameterisation has several advantages over the usual shape and scale
parameterisation in terms of interpretability. This can be of great help when
working with experts to elicit priors on the parameters (Bayesian setting).
Furthermore, the Mmax and mean parameters are less correlated than the 
shape and scale parameters, which can be of help when performing inference.
